# üéì Ethical Admissions Algorithm Simulation

This repository is a classroom exercise exploring **ethics and fairness in algorithmic decision-making** ‚Äî specifically in college admissions.

You‚Äôll implement and reflect on how feature selection and weighting can impact fairness, transparency, and equity in automated systems.

## üß© Overview

You are part of the admissions committee for **Anonymous University**, located near Anonymous City.  
Due to a large number of applications, the committee decides to use an algorithm to help **rank and shortlist applicants**.

Your task:
- Decide which factors to include (GPA, test scores, extracurriculars, essays, recommendation letters, legacy status, income, etc.)
- Assign weights to each factor.
- Compare outcomes under two models:
  - **Blind model**: Ignores sensitive factors.
  - **Aware model**: Includes them intentionally to promote fairness (e.g., extra weight for first-gen or low-income applicants).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

You can run the code on any online Java compiler (e.g. [Replit](https://replit.com/~) or [Programiz Java Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler))  
or locally via terminal:

```bash
javac Applicant.java Admissions.java Main.java
java Main





I have changed the disability, age and high income to be sensitive factors.
It heavily favors under 18, local, high income and non- disabled people, changed in the aware factors.
These factors, I find to be less relevant to hiring quality I wanted to see how much the blind admission model was affected by these changes. It seems that the admission model is moderately affected by these severe weight changes, as the admission rate dropped to half.
